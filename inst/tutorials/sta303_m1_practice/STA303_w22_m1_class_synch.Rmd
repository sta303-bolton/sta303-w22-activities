## Instructions

To participate in this activity you will need have to two windows readily available to you:

1) Your Zoom window  
2) The Team Up! activity linked from Quercus in a browser window for voting.

I would recommend that one member of the team shares their screen with the rest of the team and shows this activity where you can see the question and options.

Note 1: In the Team Up! activity you will just see the letters for the questions, not the options themselves. 

Note 2: There are hints for some questions, but if you get really stuck, please use the 'Ask for Help' option in Zoom.
